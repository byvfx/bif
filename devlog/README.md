# Development Logs

This directory contains detailed session logs for the BIF project development. Each file documents what was accomplished during a coding session, decisions made, and lessons learned.

## Format

Files are named `DEVLOG_YYYY-MM-DD.md` and follow a consistent structure:

- Session Duration
- Goals
- What I Did
- Learnings
- Next Session

## Purpose

These logs serve as:

- Context restoration between sessions (side project with gaps)
- Learning journal for Rust concepts
- Decision documentation (why, not just what)
- Progress tracking and pattern identification
