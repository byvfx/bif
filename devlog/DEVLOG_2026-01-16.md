## Key Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `crates/bif_viewport/src/shaders/basic.wgsl` | Align headlight lighting with camera view space |

| `docs/` | Milestone updates for MaterialX completion |
| `assets/` | Updated Lucy asset hashes/sizes |
| `renders/` | Updated MaterialX screenshot |

## Learnings
- Camera-locked lighting requires normals and light direction in the same space
- UI panels should be accounted for when placing overlay viewports

## Tests
Not run (viewport and asset changes only).
